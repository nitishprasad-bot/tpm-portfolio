# Technical Product Manager Portfolio Projects

A collection of technical proof-of-concepts demonstrating product thinking, technical understanding, and execution skills.

## About

This repository showcases my journey building technical skills relevant to Technical Product Management, including:

- API integrations and system design
- Data analysis and product metrics
- Automation and workflow optimization
- Full-stack development awareness

## Quick Start

**Starting a new project?** Run:

```bash
./new-project.sh
```

Then tell Claude Code:

> "Let's work on [project-name]. Please follow the guidelines in `.claude-instructions.md` and use `CHECKLIST.md` to track our progress."

**Full setup guide**: See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md)

## Development Tools

This portfolio uses AI-assisted development with quality checks:

- **Claude Code** - AI pair programming with specialized agents
- **TuringMind Code Review** - AI-powered bug and security detection ([Setup Guide](TURINGMIND_SETUP.md))
- **Pre-commit Hooks** - Automated formatting and secret detection
- **Security Guidelines** - [SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md](SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md)

## Projects

_Projects will be added here as they are completed_

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL
- **Frameworks:** React, Node.js, Flask/FastAPI
- **Tools:** Docker, Git, VS Code

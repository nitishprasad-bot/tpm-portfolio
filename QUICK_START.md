## Start Your First Project in 3 Steps

### 1. Copy the Template

```bash
cd /Users/nitish/VS\ Code\ Projects/tpm-portfolio
cp -r _project-template api-dashboard
cd api-dashboard
```

### 2. Plan Your Project

Create a GitHub issue:
- Go to: https://github.com/nitishprasad-bot/tpm-portfolio/issues/new/choose
- Choose "New Project"
- Fill in the details for your first project

### 3. Start Building

Edit the files:
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `docs/PRD.md` - Requirements and user stories
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical design
- `src/` - Your code goes here

## Suggested First Project: API Integration Dashboard

**Goal:** Build a dashboard that pulls data from multiple public APIs

**Why it's good for TPM:**
- Shows API understanding
- Demonstrates system integration
- Data visualization
- Full-stack awareness

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Python + Flask or Node.js + Express
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or React)
- APIs: Weather API, News API, Stock API (all free)

**Time: 1-2 weeks**

### Steps:
1. Research free APIs (weatherapi.com, newsapi.org, etc.)
2. Build backend to fetch and aggregate data
3. Create simple frontend to display it
4. Add error handling and caching
5. Document everything in README

## Optional: Set Up Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Set up hooks (run from repo root)
cd /Users/nitish/VS\ Code\ Projects/tpm-portfolio
pre-commit install
```

## Track Your Progress

Use GitHub Issues to:
- Plan projects (New Project template)
- Track bugs (Bug Report template)
- Add features (Feature Enhancement template)

## Tips for Success

1. **Commit often** with clear messages
2. **Document as you build** - don't leave it for the end
3. **Focus on completion** - better to finish one project well than start many
4. **Show your thinking** - explain WHY you made technical decisions

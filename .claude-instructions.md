# Instructions for Claude Code

**IMPORTANT**: When working on projects in this portfolio, always follow these guidelines.

## Project Context

This is a Technical Product Manager (TPM) portfolio repository. Every project demonstrates:

- Technical understanding and execution
- Product thinking and decision-making
- Professional documentation and communication
- Ability to ship complete, working projects

## Code Quality Standards

### Python

- Use Black formatter (max line length: 100)
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Use type hints where helpful
- No `print()` statements for debugging (use logging)

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use Prettier for formatting
- ES6+ features preferred
- camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes
- No `console.log()` for debugging (use proper logging)

### General

- Meaningful variable/function names (no `x`, `temp`, `data` without context)
- Small, focused functions (prefer 20 lines or less)
- Comment the WHY, not the WHAT
- Remove all dead/commented code
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials

## Git Commit Standards

All commits must follow this format:

```
<type>: <short summary>

<optional detailed description>

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

## Documentation Requirements

Every project MUST have:

1. **README.md** with:

   - Problem statement (what problem does this solve?)
   - Solution approach
   - Tech stack
   - Setup instructions that actually work
   - Usage examples
   - Screenshots or demo
   - Key learnings section

2. **docs/PRD.md** with:

   - User stories
   - Success metrics
   - Requirements (functional and non-functional)

3. **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** with:
   - System design diagram
   - Key design decisions and rationale
   - Trade-offs considered
   - API documentation (if applicable)

## Development Workflow

1. **Always start with planning**:

   - Fill out PRD.md before writing code
   - Sketch architecture before implementation
   - Define success criteria upfront

2. **Build incrementally**:

   - Start with MVP features
   - Commit frequently with clear messages
   - Update documentation as you build

3. **Focus on completion**:
   - Working end-to-end > partially implemented features
   - Simple and complete > complex and unfinished
   - Professional quality > quantity

## Security & Best Practices

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Security is NOT optional. Review [SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md](SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md) for comprehensive guidance.

### Security-First Development Mindset

- **Never hardcode secrets**: Use environment variables for ALL API keys, passwords, credentials
- **Validate all user input**: Whitelist allowed values, sanitize before use
- **Prevent injection attacks**: Use parameterized queries, escape output
- **Follow OWASP Top 10:2025**: Review applicable vulnerabilities for your project
- **Secure authentication**: Use bcrypt/argon2 for passwords, implement proper session management
- **Scan dependencies**: Run `npm audit` or `pip-audit` regularly
- **Handle errors securely**: Don't expose stack traces or internal details to users
- **No debug code in commits**: Remove all `console.log()`, `print()`, or debug statements
- **Review SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md** before considering a project complete

### Automated Security

Pre-commit hooks will check for:

- Hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords)
- Large files
- Trailing whitespace
- YAML/JSON syntax

Run manually: `pre-commit run --all-files`

## TPM-Specific Considerations

Show product thinking by:

- Explaining design decisions in ARCHITECTURE.md
- Documenting trade-offs (speed vs. complexity, cost vs. features)
- Including success metrics in PRD
- Demonstrating user-centric thinking
- Showing prioritization rationale

## What NOT to Do

❌ Skip documentation "to do later"
❌ Leave projects half-finished
❌ Over-engineer simple solutions
❌ Add features not in the original scope (scope creep)
❌ Copy code without understanding it
❌ Commit without testing

## Before Calling a Project "Done"

Check CHECKLIST.md in the project directory and ensure:

- All features work end-to-end
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- Code is clean and professional
- README has screenshots/demo
- Learnings section is filled out
- Main portfolio README is updated

## How to Reference These Rules

When starting a new project conversation, remind Claude:

- "Please follow the guidelines in `.claude-instructions.md`"
- "Check CHECKLIST.md to ensure we meet all requirements"
- "Use the templates in `_project-template/`"

## File Structure to Always Use

```
project-name/
├── docs/
│   ├── PRD.md
│   └── ARCHITECTURE.md
├── src/           # Source code here
├── tests/         # Tests here
├── README.md
├── CHECKLIST.md
├── .env.example
└── requirements.txt or package.json
```

**Remember**: Quality over quantity. Build things you're proud to show recruiters.
